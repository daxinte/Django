Throughout this tutorial, we’ll walk you through the creation of a basic poll application with Python 2.7 and Django 1.11. (v.1.0)

It’ll consist of two parts:

A public site that lets people view polls and vote in them.
An admin site that lets you add, change, and delete polls.

I use Virtualenv to create isolated Python environments.
And this is inside:

Creating a project
Creating the Polls app
Database setup (PostgreSQL)
Creating models
Playing with the API
Public interface – “views.”
Simple form processing and use generic views
Introducing automated testing
Add a stylesheet
Customize the admin
