##### H5 Throughout this tutorial, we’ll walk you through the creation of a basic poll application with Python 2.7 and Django 1.11. (v.1.0)

It’ll consist of two parts:

A public site that lets people view polls and vote in them.
An admin site that lets you add, change, and delete polls.

I use Virtualenv to create isolated Python environments.
And this is inside:

1.Creating a project<br />
2.Creating the Polls app<br />
3.Database setup (PostgreSQL)<br />
4.Creating models<br />
5.Playing with the API<br />
6.Public interface – “views.”<br />
7.Simple form processing and use generic views<br />
8.Introducing automated testing<br />
9.Add a stylesheet<br />
10.Customize the admin<br />
