##### H5 Throughout this tutorial, we’ll walk you through the creation of a basic poll application with Python 2.7 and Django 1.11. (v.1.0)

It’ll consist of two parts:

A public site that lets people view polls and vote in them.
An admin site that lets you add, change, and delete polls.

I use Virtualenv to create isolated Python environments.
And this is inside:

1.Creating a project
2.Creating the Polls app
3.Database setup (PostgreSQL)
4.Creating models
5.Playing with the API
6.Public interface – “views.”
7.Simple form processing and use generic views
8.Introducing automated testing
9.Add a stylesheet
10.Customize the admin
